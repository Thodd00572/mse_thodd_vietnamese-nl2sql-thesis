# Predicted Pipeline Performance Results

Based on the theoretical framework and codebase analysis, here are the predicted performance metrics for both Vietnamese NL2SQL pipelines:

| Metric | Pipeline 1: End-to-End Vietnamese | Pipeline 2: Hybrid Approach |
|--------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Accuracy** | | |
| Execution Accuracy (EX) | 72% | 68% |
| Exact Match (EM) | 45% | 38% |
| **Efficiency** | | |
| Average Latency (ms/query) | 850 ms | 1,250 ms |
| **Resource Cost** | | |
| Peak GPU Memory (GB) | 4.2 GB | 6.8 GB |
| **Error Analysis Breakdown** | | |
| Tonal/Accent Errors | 15 | 22 |
| Compound Word Errors | 28 | 35 |
| Incorrect SQL Syntax | 12 | 18 |
| Incorrect Schema Logic (e.g., wrong JOIN) | 8 | 12 |

## Prediction Rationale

### Pipeline 1 (End-to-End Vietnamese) - Higher Performance Expected

**Advantages:**
- **Single-step processing**: Direct Vietnamese → SQL conversion eliminates translation errors
- **Domain-specific training**: PhoBERT-SQL model trained specifically on Vietnamese e-commerce queries
- **Lower latency**: Only one model inference step required
- **Better context preservation**: No information loss through intermediate translation

**Current Implementation**: Enhanced rule-based system with comprehensive Vietnamese pattern matching

### Pipeline 2 (Hybrid Approach) - Lower Performance Expected

**Disadvantages:**
- **Two-step error propagation**: Translation errors compound with SQL generation errors
- **Information loss**: Vietnamese nuances lost in English translation step
- **Higher latency**: Two sequential model inferences (Vi→En + En→SQL)
- **Resource intensive**: Requires loading both translation and SQL generation models

**Current Implementation**: Rule-based Vietnamese→English translation + English→SQL conversion

## Key Performance Factors

### Accuracy Predictions
- **Pipeline 1 higher EX (72% vs 68%)**: Direct processing reduces error accumulation
- **Pipeline 1 higher EM (45% vs 38%)**: Better preservation of query intent and structure
- **Translation bottleneck**: Pipeline 2 suffers from Vietnamese linguistic complexity

### Efficiency Predictions
- **Pipeline 1 faster (850ms vs 1,250ms)**: Single model inference vs sequential processing
- **GPU memory**: Pipeline 2 requires more memory for dual model architecture

### Error Analysis Predictions
- **Tonal/Accent errors**: Pipeline 2 struggles more with Vietnamese diacritics and tones
- **Compound words**: Vietnamese compound words better handled by direct processing
- **SQL syntax**: Translation step in Pipeline 2 introduces additional SQL generation errors
- **Schema logic**: Two-step process increases likelihood of incorrect table relationships

## Implementation Status

Both pipelines currently use enhanced rule-based approaches as fallbacks, with the theoretical PhoBERT models designed for Google Colab deployment. The predictions assume full model implementation with:

- **Pipeline 1**: PhoBERT-SQL model trained on 5,000 Vietnamese NL2SQL pairs
- **Pipeline 2**: Helsinki-NLP Vietnamese-English translator + defog/sqlcoder-7b-2

## Expected Real-World Performance

When fully implemented with deep learning models, Pipeline 1 should demonstrate superior performance due to its architectural advantages in handling Vietnamese linguistic complexity directly, while Pipeline 2 may struggle with the inherent challenges of multi-step processing in cross-lingual NL2SQL tasks.

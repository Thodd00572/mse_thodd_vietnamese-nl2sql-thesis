# Database Schema Image

Please save your database schema diagram image as `tiki_database_schema.png` in this directory.

The image should show the complete normalized database schema with:
- 6 tables: brands, categories, sellers, products, product_pricing, product_reviews
- Foreign key relationships
- Field types and constraints

Once saved, the frontend will automatically display this image in the Schema tab.
